"""
Text‑to‑Speech integration (e.g., ElevenLabs) for Nova Agent.

This module contains a placeholder for synthesising speech from
text using a third‑party text‑to‑speech service such as
ElevenLabs. Implementations should send a request to the TTS
service, specifying the desired voice and returning the path or
URL to the generated audio file.

Environment variables expected:
    TTS_API_KEY: API key for the TTS service.
    TTS_VOICE_ID: Identifier for the voice to use.

See ElevenLabs' documentation for details:
https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api-reference/text-to-speech

    """Generate a speech audio file from text using a TTS provider.

    This function currently implements integration with the ElevenLabs
    text‑to‑speech API. It requires the environment variable
    ``TTS_API_KEY`` to be set. Optionally, ``TTS_VOICE_ID`` can be
    defined to specify a default voice. You may override this default
    by passing ``voice_id`` as a keyword argument. The API response
    will be saved to a temporary file on disk, and the path to this
    file is returned.

    Args:
        text: The text content to convert to speech.
        voice_id: Optional voice identifier. If not provided, the
            value of ``TTS_VOICE_ID`` from the environment will be
            used. Consult your TTS provider for valid voice IDs.
        format: Audio file format (e.g., "mp3", "wav"). The file
            extension of the saved audio will match this format.

    Returns:
        The absolute path to the generated audio file.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If required environment variables are missing.
        requests.RequestException: If an HTTP error occurs during
            synthesis.
