"""Celery task definitions for Nova.

This module defines asynchronous tasks that can be scheduled or
executed via a Celery worker.  Tasks include posting videos to
multiple platforms using the platform manager and generating
weekly performance digests and landing pages for top prompts.

To enable these tasks, ensure that a Celery worker is running
with the appropriate broker and backend configured in
``celeryconfig.py``.  For example::

    celery -A tasks worker --beat --loglevel=info

The ``beat`` scheduler can be used to automatically trigger
``weekly_digest`` at a regular cadence (e.g. weekly) by adding
an entry to ``celeryconfig.py``.
