    id: str
    title: str
    description: str
    expected_improvement: str
    confidence: float
    priority: int
    category: str
    created_at: datetime
    status: str

@dataclass
class Experiment:
    id: str
    hypothesis_id: str
    name: str
    description: str
    parameters: Dict[str, Any]
    control_group: Dict[str, Any]

## How It Works

### 1. Performance Analysis
The system continuously monitors Nova's performance across multiple dimensions:
- Response time
- Intent classification accuracy
- User satisfaction
- Memory efficiency
- Error rates
- Throughput

### 2. Hypothesis Generation
Based on performance analysis and recent system behavior, the AI generates hypotheses such as:
- "Increasing NLP confidence threshold from 0.7 to 0.8 will improve accuracy by 15%"
- "Reducing context history size from 50 to 30 will improve response time by 20%"
- "Adding semantic similarity caching will reduce memory usage by 25%"

### 3. Experiment Design
For each high-priority hypothesis, the system designs experiments:
- **Control Group**: Current system parameters
- **Treatment Group**: Proposed parameter changes
- **Metrics**: Relevant performance indicators
- **Sample Size**: Statistically significant number of tests
- **Duration**: Appropriate time period for measurement

### 4. Experiment Execution
Experiments run automatically:
- Collect baseline metrics (control group)
- Apply treatment parameters
- Collect treatment metrics
- Calculate statistical significance
- Generate recommendations

### 5. Result Analysis
The system analyzes results to:
- Determine if improvements are statistically significant
- Calculate confidence levels
- Provide clear adoption recommendations
- Identify areas for further research

## Usage

### Automatic Operation
The research system runs automatically as part of Nova's main loop:

```python
# In nova_loop.py
report.append("\nðŸ”¬ Running Autonomous Research...")
research_result = asyncio.run(run_autonomous_research())
```

### Manual Control
You can manually trigger research cycles and view results:

```python
from nova.autonomous_research import run_autonomous_research
from nova.research_dashboard import get_dashboard_data

# Start a research cycle
result = await run_autonomous_research()

# Get dashboard data
dashboard = get_dashboard_data()
```

### API Access
The system provides REST API endpoints:

```bash
# Get research dashboard
GET /research/dashboard

# Start research cycle
POST /research/start-cycle

# Get experiment details
GET /research/experiment/{experiment_id}

# Get research insights
GET /research/insights

# List experiments
GET /research/experiments?limit=10&status=completed
