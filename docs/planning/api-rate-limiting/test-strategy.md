# Test Strategy: [Feature Name]

## Test Coverage Goals
- Target: 95% code coverage
- Unit tests: All functions
- Integration tests: All API endpoints
- Performance tests: Critical paths

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
```python
# tests/test_[feature].py
def test_[feature]_creation():
    """Test [feature] creation logic."""
    pass

def test_[feature]_validation():
    """Test input validation."""
    pass
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# tests/test_[feature]_api.py
def test_create_[feature]_endpoint(client, auth_headers):
    """Test POST /api/v1/[feature]."""
    pass
```

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with 1000 concurrent requests
- Response time benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling

## Mock Strategy
- External services mocked
- Database fixtures
- Authentication mocks

## CI/CD Integration
- Tests run on every commit
- Coverage reports generated
- Performance regression checks
