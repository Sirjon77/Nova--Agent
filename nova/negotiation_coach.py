"""Negotiation Coach Module.

This module contains a basic framework for constructing negotiation
playbooks.  The ``NegotiationCoach`` class provides methods to build
a negotiation framework tailored to a given industry and target
audience.  Each framework includes a preparation checklist,
communication strategies and a closing plan.  This skeleton can be
expanded with advanced negotiation tactics, case studies or NLP
techniques to optimise deal outcomes.
