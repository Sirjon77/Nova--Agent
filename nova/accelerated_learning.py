"""Accelerated Learning Coach Module.

This module defines scaffolding for creating one-day learning plans.  It
targets quick skill acquisition and high-performance training.  The
``LearningCoach`` class uses basic heuristics to divide a day into
segments focusing on theory, practice and reflection.  Future
versions may incorporate spaced repetition algorithms or adapt to
individual learning styles.
