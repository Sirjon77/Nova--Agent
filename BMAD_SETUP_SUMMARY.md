## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Check GitHub Actions Status**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Sirjon77/Nova--Agent/actions
   - Verify CI pipeline is now passing with our fixes

2. **Update Cursor Custom Modes**
   - Open Cursor settings
   - Update any custom agent modes per BMAD installer note

3. **Read BMAD User Guide**
   - Location: `.bmad-core/user-guide.md`
   - Understand the Plan → Execute workflow

### BMAD Workflow Overview:

1. **Planning Phase** (Web UI or IDE)
   - Analyst: Research & Project Brief
   - PM: Create PRD with requirements
   - UX: Create front-end specs (if needed)
   - Architect: Design system architecture
   - QA: Early test strategy

2. **Execution Phase** (IDE)
   - SM: Shard stories for development
   - Dev: Implement features
   - QA: Validate and test
   - Continuous refinement loop

### Available BMAD Commands:
```bash
# Install/update BMAD
npm run bmad:install

# Flatten codebase for context
npm run bmad:flatten

# Start planning workflow (if using web UI)
npx bmad-method plan

# Start orchestrator
npx bmad-method orchestrator
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Known Issues:
1. **Flatten command syntax**: The v4.39.0 flatten command has parsing issues, but the existing `docs/flattened-codebase.xml` file works fine

### Python Environment:
- Virtual environment active: ✅
- No PEP 668 errors: ✅
- Python 3.13.5 in use

## 📊 CI/CD Health Check:
- **Local Tests:** 39 passed, 11 skipped, 0 failed
- **Coverage:** 20% (exceeds 15% requirement)
- **Linting:** All files formatted with black/ruff
- **GitHub Actions:** Configured with debugging support

## 🎉 Summary

BMAD v4.39.0 is now fully integrated with your Nova Agent project. The CI/CD pipeline has been fixed and all tests are passing locally. The next step is to verify the GitHub Actions are passing and begin using the BMAD workflow for your development process.
